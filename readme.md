## Service Bus Queue Manager

One thing the Service Bus for Windows Server 1.0 lacks is a good manager to create and delete queues. This tool aims to provide that functionality by simply changing the connection string in the .config file.

## Usage

Download the source and compile it in Visual Studio 2012. Binaries will be available when the product has reached ALPHA status.

## Current status

This project is currently in development. I try to always commit working code, but don't use is on any production environment yet! (At your own risk!)
